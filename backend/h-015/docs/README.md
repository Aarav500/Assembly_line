# ExampleCo Knowledge Base

Welcome to the ExampleCo documentation.

Our mission is to keep knowledge valid even as documents change. We do this by maintaining automated QA tests
that assert critical answers remain discoverable and correct. When docs evolve, tests alert us if knowledge
regresses.

Getting started

- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start the API: python app.py
- Run the QA tests from CLI: python test_runner.py

FAQ

Q: Why automated document QA?
A: To ensure knowledge remains valid after changes and prevent regressions in what users can find.
